🎯 REPLIT AGENT PROMPT
Create a comprehensive EKG analysis system using OperatorOS that:

Accepts uploaded EKG images and processes them through the healthcare agent pool
Generates fully annotated EKGs with color-coded labels for all components
Provides downloadable annotated images in high-resolution formats
Delivers clinical interpretations alongside the visual annotations


📋 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
EKG Analysis & Annotation:

Component Labeling: P waves (red), QRS complexes (blue), T waves (green)
Interval Measurements: PR, QRS, QT intervals with measurement lines and values
Clinical Findings: ST elevation/depression, Q waves, arrhythmias with callouts
Lead Identification: Label all 12 leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1-V6)
Professional Legend: Color-coded component guide overlaid on image

Download Functionality:

High-resolution PNG for primary download
PDF report option with interpretation
Secure temporary storage with 24-hour expiration
Direct download links provided in Replit Agent conversation
Multiple format support (PNG, JPEG, PDF)

User Experience:
User: "Analyze this EKG and give me a downloadable annotated version"
[Uploads EKG image]

Expected Response:
"🏥 EKG Analysis Started
📋 Task ID: ekg_12345
