Please create a complete implementation of OperatorOS, an enterprise-grade multi-agent AI orchestration system designed specifically to work with **Replit Agent as the primary user interface**. This is an unconventional architecture where all user interactions happen through Replit Agent conversations rather than traditional web interfaces.

## Unconventional Architecture Overview

**Key Design Principle**: Replit Agent serves as both the development environment AND the primary user interface for the entire OperatorOS system. Users interact with the AI orchestration platform through natural language conversations with Replit Agent, which then executes the appropriate backend operations.

### Architecture Components
- **Replit Agent**: Primary UI layer - handles all user interactions via conversational interface
- **Flask API Backend**: Headless API server for system operations (no traditional web UI)
- **Agent Master Controller**: Core orchestration engine with enterprise-grade features
- **Specialized Agent Pools**: Domain-specific AI agents accessible through Replit Agent
- **OpenAI Assistants Integration**: Persistent conversation management
- **Command Interface**: CLI-style commands that Replit Agent can execute

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Main Entry Point (main.py)
```python
# Primary interface for Replit Agent interactions
# Command routing and response formatting
# Session management for multiple users
# Interactive menu system accessible through conversation
# Real-time system status reporting via text
```

### 2. Replit Interface Layer (replit_interface.py)
```python
# Core interface between Replit Agent and OperatorOS
# Natural language command parsing
# Conversational response formatting
# Multi-user session management
# Context-aware interaction handling
```

### 3. Command Processor (command_processor.py)
```python
# Parse natural language commands from Replit Agent
# Execute system operations based on conversational input
# Format responses in conversational/text format
# Handle complex multi-step operations
# Provide help and guidance through conversation
```

### 4. Conversation Manager (conversation_manager.py)
```python
# Manage multiple user sessions through Replit Agent
# Maintain conversation context and history
# Handle concurrent users and conversations
# Session persistence and recovery
# User authentication through conversational flow
```

### 5. Headless Flask Backend (app.py)
```python
# API-only Flask application (no web templates)
# RESTful endpoints for internal operations
# Health check endpoints
# System metrics API
# Database management
# Background task processing
```

## Replit Agent Interaction Patterns

### 1. System Status Commands
Users can ask Replit Agent:
- "Show me the system status"
- "How are the agent pools performing?"
- "What tasks are currently running?"
- "Display health metrics"

### 2. Task Submission
Users interact naturally:
- "I need medical advice about chest pain symptoms"
- "Analyze AAPL stock performance and give investment recommendations" 
- "Help me automate my project management workflow"
- "Create a sports betting strategy for tonight's games"

### 3. Agent Pool Management
Through conversation:
- "Scale up the healthcare agent pool"
- "Check the status of financial agents"
- "Restart failed agents"
- "Show me agent performance metrics"

### 4. Interactive Demos
- "Show me a healthcare demo"
- "Walk me through financial analysis capabilities"
- "Demonstrate sports analytics features"
- "Run a business automation example"

## Core Components Implementation

### 1. Database Models (models.py)
**Same comprehensive models as before but optimized for API access:**
- User sessions...
