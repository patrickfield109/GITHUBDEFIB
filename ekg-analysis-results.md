# Enhanced EKG Analysis System - Expert Cardiologist Protocols

## System Overview

OperatorOS now features a comprehensive EKG analysis system with expert cardiologist-level protocols, providing medical-grade accuracy and professional downloadable annotations.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. **Expert Cardiologist Protocols (20+ Years Experience)**
- Systematic analysis approach following clinical best practices
- Grid-based precise measurements (1 square = 40ms horizontally)
- Conservative diagnostic approach with uncertainty flagging
- Clinical correlation with territorial pattern recognition

### 2. **Comprehensive Analysis Components**

#### **Rhythm Analysis:**
- Regular vs irregular rhythm determination
- P wave identification and morphology assessment
- Heart rate calculation using R-R intervals
- Rhythm type classification (sinus, atrial fib, flutter, etc.)

#### **Axis Determination:**
- QRS axis assessment in frontal plane
- Normal axis: -30° to +90°
- Left/right axis deviation detection

#### **Precise Interval Measurements:**
- PR interval: Normal 120-200ms
- QRS duration: Normal <120ms
- QT interval with QTc calculation (Bazett's formula)
- Grid square precision counting

#### **Lead-Specific Morphology Analysis:**
- **Limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF):** Q wave and R wave progression
- **Precordial leads (V1-V6):** R wave progression, ST segments, T waves
- Pathological Q wave detection (>40ms or >25% R wave height)

#### **Advanced Pattern Recognition:**
- **STEMI patterns:** ST elevation with reciprocal depression
- **NSTEMI:** ST depression, T wave inversions without elevation
- **Bundle branch blocks:** QRS >120ms with specific morphology
- **Atrial fibrillation:** Irregular R-R, no distinct P waves
- **Ventricular rhythms:** Wide QRS, AV dissociation

### 3. **Professional Annotation System**

#### **Color-Coded Component Identification:**
- **Red markers:** P wave locations with pixel coordinates
- **Blue markers:** QRS complex peaks with coordinates
- **Green markers:** T wave peaks with coordinates
- **Measurement lines:** PR intervals, QRS width, QT intervals
- **All 12 leads:** Individual lead-specific annotations

#### **Clinical Output Format:**
- Precise measurements (HR, PR, QRS, QT, QTc)
- Component locations with pixel coordinates
- Abnormality severity scoring (1-10 scale)
- Confidence levels for each finding (0-100%)
- Clinical urgency level (routine, urgent, emergent)
- Specific diagnostic considerations
- Territorial analysis for ischemic changes

### 4. **Medical-Grade Documentation**
- High-resolution PNG downloads (print-ready)
- Comprehensive PDF clinical reports
- Appropriate educational disclaimers
- Professional medical formatting standards
- Secure 24-hour download expiration

## User Experience Workflow

1. **Upload:** Submit EKG image via conversational interface
2. **Analysis:** Expert 20+ year cardiologist protocol processing
3. **Annotation:** Professional color-coded component labeling
4. **Download:** High-resolution annotated image and detailed report
5. **Clinical Review:** Comprehensive interpretation with confidence levels

## Technical Implementation

### **API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/analyze-ekg` - Direct EKG analysis with annotations
- `GET /api/download/:filename` - Secure file download system
- Conversational interface integration for natural language requests

### **Enhanced AI Integration:**
- OpenAI GPT-4 Vision with expert cardiologist prompt
- Systematic analysis protocol following medical standards
- Conservative diagnostic approach with uncertainty handling
- Fallback to Anthropic Claude for additional validation

### **Quality Assurance:**
- Medical disclaimer compliance
- Educational purpose specification
- Professional consultation recommendations
- Accuracy confidence scoring system
